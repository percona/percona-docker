# Percona Docker Images Collection

This repository contains a collection of Dockerfiles for Percona software. Dockerfiles can be used to customize and build docker images.
Read more about Dockerfiles [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

See individual directories for instructions on how to build and run Percona software.

The images we build can be found in the Docker Hub registry. We have two organizations:

- [percona](https://hub.docker.com/u/percona) - repository with production-grade images that are widely used by the community and customers.
- [perconalab](https://hub.docker.com/u/perconalab) - experiments, alpha/beta versions, nightly builds images. Not recommended for production.
